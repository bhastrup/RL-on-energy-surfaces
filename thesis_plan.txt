Project time line:


September 15th:
- Learn about state of the art methods for finding transition pathways in small chemical systems, focus particularly on the Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) method.
- Find and study scientific papers on reinforcement learning (RL) for molecular structure generation, see fx. the ASLA method (Hammer's group) and the MolGym method.
- Build a reinforcement learning environment on-top of the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) library in python.


September 22nd:
- Build a unintelligent/untrained agent the explores a bit of configuration space before being dragged towards the goal state. This is done in order to gather relevant trajectory data from which an intelligent agent can later be trained. 


September 30th:
- Build an initial "dummy" neural network (to be replaced with physics inspired neural network) to solve the hollow-to-hollow (fcc) jumping of a Cu adsorbate on a Cu surface (fcc111). 


October 15th:
- Implement and compare both a policy based RL agent such as policy gradient/A3C, and a pure value based Deep-Q agent to see which one should be used throughout the project.
- Implement a physics inpspired neural network architecture for state representation of the local chemical surroundings such as the Cormorant architecture.


October 31st:
- Implement alternative deep neural networks (such as 3d-convolutional NNs) against which the physics inspired network (Cormorant fx) can be benchmarked in order to assess the utility of using rotationally invariant networks. 


November 20th:
- Solve a range of engineering challenges related to yet unknown obstacles that inevitably will appear and hinder the smooth realization of aforementioned goals.


November 30th:
- Devise a strategy to train the agent on increasingly more difficult chemical systems.


December 1st to January 31st:
- Start writing the thesis.
- Train agent to find non-intuitive pathways inaccessible the NEB method.
- Demolish obstacles.


From February 1st, all time is devoted to thesis writing.
